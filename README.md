# Building Trust Into Your Platform

TruAnon is a trust layer — not a verification gate, not KYC. Members anchor their identity once using accounts the world already knows them by: GitHub, LinkedIn, Bluesky, their own domain. That history reflects back as a rank, score, and color that travels with them everywhere TruAnon is adopted. Platforms weave it in. Members control it. It runs itself.

## Anchor, Grant, Revoke

**Anchor** — A member connects their TruAnon identity to your platform. Once. Cannot be undone. Rank and verified properties follow automatically. A banned member cannot return under a new account — the anchor persists. This is structural, not a policy.

For honest members, anchoring is a gesture of good faith — accountability they offer freely because they have nothing to hide. For fraudsters, the same anchor is a binding liability. Every benefit flips to risk: accountability is exposure, permanence is a trap. They walk away to platforms where the calculus works in their favor. They self-select out.

**Grant** — The member turns on visibility of specific data categories. The platform decides which to surface; the member decides whether to share each one.

**Revoke** — The member turns off visibility. Status returns to `Unknown`. The anchor remains. Going dark is always an option. Erasing an anchor is not.

Unknown covers both states — never anchored and anchored-but-revoked look identical to any viewer. Avoiding is as clear as having it. On a platform where most members anchor, that choice is conspicuous — in a way that belongs entirely to them. Unknown is a social prompt: interaction reveals intention.

## Rank

Rank is a mirror, not a meter. It reflects the depth, consistency, and transparency of a member's existing public presence — not something they earned. 60+ days of continuous, visible, active presence is the meaningful signal. The rank is live: remove your name from a public profile and it drops; establish a long-active presence and it rises. The member didn't gain anything they didn't already have — the rank made it visible.

| Rank | What it reflects |
|------|-----------------|
| **Genuine** | Deepest, most consistent, most transparent public presence |
| **Reliable** | Strong public history with real visibility |
| **Credible** | Meaningful public presence — statistically equivalent to ID verification |
| **Cautioned** | Confused signals — some visible, some hidden. Not permanent; the member can improve. |
| **Dangerous** | Abandonment or active concealment. Cautioned → Dangerous within days is the threat actor pattern. |

Unknown is the baseline, not a rank. Regular people naturally move up over time. Credible is all most platforms need as a gate.

## The Badge

Show rank, score, and color together — always. Never reduce to a checkmark; that discards most of the value. The score is a universal confidence reading: a 4.2 means the same level of trust and transparency for any member, regardless of which properties back it.

The badge is a design canvas: a small pill inline with a username, a card on a profile, or a full achievement. The design is yours.

**Achievements:** When a member grants visibility to GitHub, LinkedIn, TikTok, or any social property, your server can query that platform's API with the verified account. The link may never be shown to viewers — the derived badge is yours. "Verified Developer," "Active Creator" — whatever fits your platform. Verified properties are both a display signal and a data source your platform can act on independently.

---

## What You Display

This is an API that returns structured identity data. You decide what to render — if anything.

A healthcare portal uses rank as a server-side gate and shows nothing. A classifieds platform shows Genuine 4.5 on every listing — no profile page required. A pseudonymous community shows rank next to a username with no identity visible. A dating app shows age range and location, private by default, social links never surfaced to strangers.

`anchors` contains only what the member has granted. Filter by `kind`:

| `kind` | What it contains |
|--------|-----------------|
| `personal` | Location, age, gender, bio |
| `social` | Platform links — GitHub, LinkedIn, TikTok, etc. |
| `contact` | Full name, preferred contact |
| `primary` | Confirmed phone/email — description only, never the raw value |

`"Privately Confirmed Phone"` means TruAnon confirmed the number. Your platform never receives it.

**You cannot be compelled to reveal what you do not have.** The platform stores rank, score, and a photo — derived trust data, not PII. A database breach exposes nothing that identifies or contacts anyone. A subpoena cannot reach what was never stored.

## The API

```
GET https://truanon.com/api/v2/get_profile?id=[USERNAME]&service=[SERVICENAME]
Authorization: [YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]
```

```json
{
  "rank": "Genuine",
  "score": "5.0",
  "name": "Jesse Tayler",
  "title": "Fisherman, Scholar, Huntsman",
  "photo": "https://img.truanon.com/231-400.png",
  "ageBadge": "Over 21",
  "anchors": [
    { "name": "GitHub", "display": "github.com/jtayler",
      "icon": "fab fa-github", "type": "github", "kind": "social" },
    { "name": "Location", "display": "Manhattan",
      "icon": "fa fa-map-marked", "type": "location", "kind": "personal" },
    { "name": "Primary Phone", "display": "Privately Confirmed Phone",
      "icon": "fas fa-mobile-alt", "type": "phone", "kind": "primary" }
  ]
}
```

**`get_profile`** — on every profile where the databse shows they want identity. Fast GET. Never block the page on TruAnon — render from cache, fetch async.

**`get_token`** — once, when anchoring. Call only when `get_profile` returns an unanchored user on their edit page. After anchoring, never call again.

## The Anchor Flow

```
Member opens edit page
        │
        ▼
   Call get_profile
        │
        ├── Anchored ──► Show rank + score + privacy switches
        │
        └── Unknown ───► Call get_token → build verify URL
                              │
                              ▼
                    Open in modal (iframe) or SFSafariViewController
                              │
                              ▼
                    Member confirms on TruAnon's UI
                              │
                              ▼
                    TruAnon redirects to your callback → reload
```

```
https://truanon.com/api/verifyProfile?id=[USERNAME]&service=[SERVICENAME]&token=[TOKEN]&callback=[ENCODED_CALLBACK_URL]
```

Open however you want, in a **modal with an iframe** — not `window.open()`, which browsers block. On mobile: `SFSafariViewController` (iOS) or Chrome Custom Tabs (Android).

## Fetching

Store `is_anchored` on the user record. Set it the first time `get_profile` returns a real rank. Gate all TruAnon calls on it — if false, skip. You already know the answer.

Live TruAnon fetches belong in two places only: the profile view (async, after load) and the edit page (verify token, unanchored users only). Everything else — lists, feeds, search, comments — renders from your DB cache with zero API calls.

```javascript
function fetchWithTimeout(url, options, ms = 30000) {
    return Promise.race([
        fetch(url, options),
        new Promise((_, reject) => setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('timeout')), ms))
    ]);
}

// Render immediately from cache — badge loads async
app.get('/users/:username', (req, res) => {
    db.get('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?', [req.params.username], (err, user) => {
        if (err || !user) return res.status(404).send('Not found');
        res.render('profile', { user });
    });
});

// TruAnon proxy — called by client JS after page loads
app.get('/users/:username/truanon', async (req, res) => {
    const url = `${apiBase}get_profile?id=${req.params.username}&service=${serviceName}`;
    try {
        const response = await fetchWithTimeout(url, { headers: { Authorization: privateKey } });
        const data = await response.json();
        db.run('UPDATE users SET authorRank = ?, authorRankScore = ?, authorPhoto = ? WHERE username = ?',
            [data.rank, data.score, data.photo, req.params.username]);
        res.json(data);
    } catch {
        res.status(503).json({ error: 'TruAnon unavailable' });
    }
});
```

```javascript
// Client
fetch(`/users/${username}/truanon`)
    .then(r => r.ok ? r.json() : Promise.reject())
    .then(data => renderTruAnonBadge(data))
    .catch(() => {});
```

Cache `authorRank`, `authorRankScore`, and `authorPhoto`. Map rank to color:

```javascript
function rankToColor(rank) {
    return { Genuine: 'primary', Reliable: 'success', Credible: 'secondary',
             Cautioned: 'warning', Dangerous: 'danger' }[rank] || 'light';
}
```

## Rank as a Gate

Rank is a predicate. Check it before allowing any action — posting, messaging, booking — using your cached value. Zero added latency. The gate is structural: the anchor persists; a new account doesn't escape it.

Credible is statistically equivalent to ID verification — for most platforms, it is all you need. Once members see Credible is valued, they naturally push toward Reliable and Genuine on their own.

```javascript
const RANK_ORDER = ['Unknown', 'Cautioned', 'Dangerous', 'Credible', 'Reliable', 'Genuine'];

function meetsMinimumRank(userRank, minimumRank) {
    return RANK_ORDER.indexOf(userRank) >= RANK_ORDER.indexOf(minimumRank);
}

if (!meetsMinimumRank(user.authorRank, 'Credible')) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Credible rank required to post.' });
}
```

---

## Privacy Switches

Give the member a toggle for each category your platform surfaces.

| Switch | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Use Verified Identity** | Master toggle — off means `Unknown` everywhere |
| **Display Personal Info** | Show / hide `kind: "personal"` items |
| **Display Social Profiles** | Show / hide `kind: "social"` links |
| **Private Profile** | Data shows, all URLs removed — nothing clickable |
| **Display Contact Info** | Show / hide `kind: "contact"` and `"primary"` items |

For pseudonymous platforms, strip `social` and `contact` entries server-side unconditionally.

## Quick Integration Checklist

- [ ] Register at developer.truanon.com — get `PRIVATE_KEY` and `SERVICE_NAME`
- [ ] Proxy all TruAnon calls through your server — never expose `PRIVATE_KEY` client-side
- [ ] Store `is_anchored` on the user record — gate all TruAnon calls on it
- [ ] Cache `authorRank`, `authorRankScore`, `authorPhoto` — list views never need an API call
- [ ] Render profile pages immediately from DB cache — fetch TruAnon async from the client after load
- [ ] Display rank + score + color — never reduce to a checkmark alone
- [ ] Show *"Ask me why I haven't anchored"* for Unknown members — this is optional but highly valuable and conspicuous to avoid
- [ ] On edit page: read `is_anchored` from DB to know which state to render before any fetch
- [ ] Fetch verify token only when the member clicks Verify — not on page load
- [ ] Implement privacy switches for Personal, Contact, and Social — only show after anchoring
- [ ] For pseudonymous platforms: strip social/contact links server-side unconditionally
