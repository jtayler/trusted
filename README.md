# Introduction

This Node.js demonstration site showcases TruAnon APIs and their potential to help build trust and stop abuse on your service. This simple application allows sign up and login and editing of user profile data. This also provides a verified identity "Switch" that turns on and off the badge feature on all user profiles. This simple demonstration shows the power of using TruAnon and why members prefer this verify option above all others.

TruAnon APIs provide access to the data containing information about profile owners on your website. This document provides details on how to use these APIs to populate data on the profile view page. The API data is provided in JSON format, and proper parsing and decoding are necessary to present the data correctly.

## JSON Parsing and Decoding

1. The profile view page needs to display an identity ownerâ€™s choice of public information. The badge along with the photo border are  expected to have a border that matches their author rank, which can be dangerous, cautioned, credible, reliable, or genuine. 
2. To parse the JSON data returned from the API, first, it needs to be encoded using `encodeURIComponent()`. Then, it needs to be parsed using `JSON.parse()` twice. The result is a JSON object containing `verifiedDetails`, which can be accessed using `verifiedDetails.authorRank`.
3. The `getPhotoBorderColor()` function receives a user's author rank and returns a CSS class to add to the profile picture's border. This class sets the color of the border to the user's corresponding rank color. The function uses a switch statement to match the rank with a bootstrap color.
4. Note that the  `verifiedDetails` array contains dictionaries of matching data points you can display and use. The parsing and decoding of this are especially noteworthy but the concept is very simple; display more and ask less of your users.


## API Usage

To use TruAnon APIs, an HTTP GET request must be sent to the desired endpoint. For example, to get a user's verified details, the following endpoint should be used:

The response contains the user's verified details, including their author rank, which can be used to determine the color of their profile badge color. The response needs to be parsed and decoded properly to get the necessary data.

To populate data on the profile view page, jQuery can be used to select the desired elements by their ID and change their text or attributes. For example, to change the profile picture's border color, the jQuery `.addClass()` method can be used to add the CSS class returned by the `getPhotoBorderColor()` function to the profile picture's element.

## Conclusion

TruAnon APIs provide a convenient way to access user data for use on the profile view page. JSON parsing and decoding are necessary to use the data correctly, and proper use of jQuery can populate the data on the page.

## Route 1: Get User Profile

The first route, defined with `app.get('/users/:username', ...)`, retrieves a user's profile from the TruAnon API if the user's `switch_state` is set to `true`. Here's how the code works:

1. The route extracts the `username` parameter from the request URL and the `userId` from the session.
2. It then queries the database to retrieve the user's data using their `username`.
3. If the user is found, the route checks their `switch_state` property. If it is set to `true`, the route constructs a URL to fetch the user's profile data from the TruAnon API. It includes the `username` and `service` parameters, as well as the `Authorization` header, which is set to a private key.
4. The route then calls the `truanon.com/api/get_profile?id=[YOUR_USERNAME]&service=[YOUR_SERVICENAME]` function to make a GET request to the TruAnon API using the constructed URL and the `tokenOptions` object that contains the `Authorization` header.

## Route 2: Get User Token

The second route, defined with `app.get('/users/:username/token', ...)`, generates a token for a user using the TruAnon API. Here's how the code works:

1. The route extracts the `username` parameter from the request URL.
2. It then constructs a URL to fetch the user's token from the TruAnon API. It includes the `username` and `service` parameters, as well as the `Authorization` header, which is set to a private key.
3. The route then calls the `truanon.com/api/get_token?id=[YOUR_USERNAME]&service=[YOUR_SERVICENAME]` function to make a GET request to the TruAnon API using the constructed URL and the options object that contains the `Authorization` header.
4. The `fetch` function returns a Promise that resolves to the response object. The route uses the `json` method of the response object to parse the JSON data and obtain the user's token.
5. The route then sends a JSON response with the user's token.

In both routes, the `fetch` function is used to make requests to the TruAnon API. The `Authorization` header is set to a private key, which is passed in via environment variable.
